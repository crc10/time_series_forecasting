\title{Weighted Nearest Neighbours Forecast}
\usage{
wnn_forecast(timeseries, w = 96, h = 96, k = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{timeseries}{Numeric vector. The historical time series data.}

\item{w}{Integer. The size of the window (pattern length). Default is 96 (one day).}

\item{h}{Integer. The forecasting horizon. Default is 96 (one day).}

\item{k}{Integer. The number of nearest neighbours to select. Default is 5.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length h containing the forecast.
}
\description{
Implements the WNN forecasting method described by Talavera-Llames et al. (2016).
It finds similar patterns (windows) in the history and aggregates their future values
based on distance-weighted averaging.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Generate dummy data
  data <- sin(seq(0, 100, 0.1)) + rnorm(1001, 0, 0.1)
  # Forecast next 20 points based on pattern of length 50
  pred <- wnn_forecast(data, w = 50, h = 20, k = 3)
  plot(pred, type = 'l')
}
